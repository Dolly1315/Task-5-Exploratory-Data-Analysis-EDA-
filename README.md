# Titanic EDA - Task 5

This project is part of a data analytics internship assignment, where I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To explore the Titanic dataset and extract meaningful insights by analyzing passenger demographics, survival distribution, and relationships between variables using Python libraries.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Anaconda (for environment management)

---

## 📊 Key EDA Steps Performed

- Data overview using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.isnull()`
- Handling missing values visually
- Univariate analysis (Gender, Age, Fare)
- Bivariate analysis (Survival by Gender, Class)
- Correlation analysis using a heatmap
- Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Summary of findings

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males.
- 1st class passengers had better survival chances compared to 3rd class.
- Most passengers were between 20–30 years of age.
- Fare data had extreme outliers, especially for high-class tickets.
- Survival was correlated with passenger class and gender.
